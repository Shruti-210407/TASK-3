TASK - 3

1) Goal and Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to analyze rainfall trends across various Indian subdivisions using historical data from the rainfall_2017 dataset. This dataset included monthly and annual rainfall values from different states and union territories over several years. By grouping subdivisions into geographical zones using a secondary table RegionZone, we aimed to understand how rainfall varied regionally and temporally. The goal was to extract meaningful insights that could support water resource management, monsoon forecasting, and sustainable agricultural practices.

2) Key Insights:
The SQL analysis of rainfall data reveals that the South and Northeast zones receive the highest average annual rainfall. Subdivisions like Meghalaya, Kerala, and Andaman & Nicobar Islands show consistently high rainfall, often above 3000 mm. Seasonal trends confirm that most rainfall occurs during the JJAS (monsoon) period. The analysis also identifies the top 5 wettest years nationwide and highlights subdivisions with rainfall above the national average. A few queries track trends in specific regions and maximum rainfall events. Indexing was used to improve performance. These insights help in understanding regional rainfall patterns and planning for water resource management.
